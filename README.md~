### Updates
- Apr 02, 2019
  * The code and training prototxt for our [CVPR19](http://bhchen.cn) paper are released.
  * For simplication, we use Hinge_Loss-like adversarial constraint instead of the original adversary network (This will reduce the final performance a little but ease the training. We also provide the "gradients_reverse_layer" for the implementation of the orginal adversary network, you can try it by yourself.).
  * If you train our Network on **CUB-200**, the expected retrieval performance of **DeML(I=3,J=3)** will be ~**(R@1=64.7, R@2=75.1, R@4=83.2, R@8=89.4)** at ~10k iterations.

### Prerequisites

* Matlab (for evaluation)
* 2GPUs, each > 11G
### Train_Model
1. The Installation is completely the same as [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/). Please follow the [installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html). Make sure you have correctly installed before using our code. 
2. Download the training images [CUB]() and move it to $(your_path). The images are preprossed the same as [Lifted Loss](https://github.com/rksltnl/Deep-Metric-Learning-CVPR16/), i.e. with zero paddings.
3. Download the training_list (~400M), and move it ~/Hybrid-Attention-based-Decoupled-Metric-Learning-master/examples/CUB/ . (Or you can create your own list by randomly selecting 65 classes with 2 samples each class.)
4. Download [googlenetV1](http://dl.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/bvlc_googlenet.caffemodel) (used for U512) and [3nets]() (used for DeML3-3_512) to folder ~/Hybrid-Attention-based-Decoupled-Metric-Learning-master/examples/CUB/pre-trained-model/
5. Modify the images path by changing "root_folder" into $(your_path) in all *.prototxt .
6. Then you can train our baseline method **U512** and the proposed **DeML(I=3,J=3)** by running
```
        cd ~/Hybrid-Attention-based-Decoupled-Metric-Learning-master/examples/CUB/U512
        ./finetune_U512.sh
```     
and
```
        cd ~/Hybrid-Attention-based-Decoupled-Metric-Learning-master/examples/CUB/DeML3-3_512
        ./finetune_DeML3-3_512.sh
```     
the trained models are stored in folder "run_U512/" and "run_DeML3-3_512/" respectively.
### Extract_DeepFeature
1. run the following code for **U512** and **DeML(I=3,J=3)** respectively.
```
        cd ~/Hybrid-Attention-based-Decoupled-Metric-Learning-master/examples/CUB/U512
        ./extractfeatures.sh
```

```
        cd ~/Hybrid-Attention-based-Decoupled-Metric-Learning-master/examples/CUB/DeML3-3_512
        ./extractfeatures.sh
```
the feature files are stored at folder "features/"
### Evaluation
1. Run code in folder "~/Hybrid-Attention-based-Decoupled-Metric-Learning-master/evaluation/"
